Employee turnover is an expression that is used broadly in the business organazations around the world. Despite the face that there have been numerious studies which have been performed on this topic, there has not been any significant steps taken to examine the causes and leading factors of employee turnover in a particular organization.

In our project, huge chunks of data will be gathered among various diverse groups, and the programming language such as Python and its libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn will help us analyze the causes of Employee Turnover in an organization, thus giving us more clarity and ultimately recommending ways to prevent the turnover in major orgainzations.
